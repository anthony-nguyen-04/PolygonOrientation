# PolygonOrientation

This algorithm seeks to determine the orientation of a polygon (clockwise or counterclockwise), given the order of the polygon.

Run PolygonCreator.py to create X amount of polygons of either clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Then, run PolygonChecker.py to determine the orientation for a random sample of polygons (from the ones created earlier).
